### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection,
2. Handling missing values,
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis
This include some interesting code/features worked with
as shown in the Kpi file. 

### Result Findings 
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- Orders are highest on weekends, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays.
- The months of July and January see the maximum orders.
- The classic category and large size pizzas contribute to maximum sales and total orders.

### Recommendations
- Given the high order volume on weekends and in the months of July and January, it would be beneficial to invest in marketing and promotions during these times.
- Since the classic category and large size pizzas contribute to maximum sales, focus should be on expanding and promoting these products.
- A customer-segmentation strategy could be implemented to target customers who prefer the classic category and large size pizzas. This could help in effectively targeting high-LTV customers.


### Limitations:
The report is based on a specific time period (Jan’15 - Dec’15), and the trends may have changed in the subsequent years.
The report does not consider factors like promotional activities, competition, and market conditions, which can significantly impact sales.
The report assumes that customer preferences for pizza categories and sizes will remain the same, which may not be the case.

### Reference
This report is based on the sales data of the pizza company from Jan’15 - Dec’15. For a more accurate and current analysis, it would be beneficial to consider recent sales data and market trends.
